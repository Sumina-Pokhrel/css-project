        narrative when investigators discover that Tonya Hughes is not her real name. The film traces
        the life of Sharon Marshall, revealing she was abducted as a child by Franklin Floyd, who raised
        her under false identities. He subjected her to years of abuse, ultimately posing as her husband.
